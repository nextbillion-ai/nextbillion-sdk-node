# Nextbillion SDK TypeScript MCP Server

It is generated with [Stainless](https://www.stainless.com/).

## Installation

### Direct invocation

You can run the MCP Server directly via `npx`:

```sh
export NEXTBILLION_SDK_API_KEY="My API Key"
npx -y @nbai/sdk-mcp@latest
```

### Via MCP Client

There is a partial list of existing clients at [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients). If you already
have a client, consult their documentation to install the MCP server.

For clients with a configuration JSON, it might look something like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nbai_sdk_api": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@nbai/sdk-mcp", "--client=claude", "--tools=dynamic"],
      "env": {
        "NEXTBILLION_SDK_API_KEY": "My API Key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Exposing endpoints to your MCP Client

There are two ways to expose endpoints as tools in the MCP server:

1. Exposing one tool per endpoint, and filtering as necessary
2. Exposing a set of tools to dynamically discover and invoke endpoints from the API

### Filtering endpoints and tools

You can run the package on the command line to discover and filter the set of tools that are exposed by the
MCP Server. This can be helpful for large APIs where including all endpoints at once is too much for your AI's
context window.

You can filter by multiple aspects:

- `--tool` includes a specific tool by name
- `--resource` includes all tools under a specific resource, and can have wildcards, e.g. `my.resource*`
- `--operation` includes just read (get/list) or just write operations

### Dynamic tools

If you specify `--tools=dynamic` to the MCP server, instead of exposing one tool per endpoint in the API, it will
expose the following tools:

1. `list_api_endpoints` - Discovers available endpoints, with optional filtering by search query
2. `get_api_endpoint_schema` - Gets detailed schema information for a specific endpoint
3. `invoke_api_endpoint` - Executes any endpoint with the appropriate parameters

This allows you to have the full set of API endpoints available to your MCP Client, while not requiring that all
of their schemas be loaded into context at once. Instead, the LLM will automatically use these tools together to
search for, look up, and invoke endpoints dynamically. However, due to the indirect nature of the schemas, it
can struggle to provide the correct properties a bit more than when tools are imported explicitly. Therefore,
you can opt-in to explicit tools, the dynamic tools, or both.

See more information with `--help`.

All of these command-line options can be repeated, combined together, and have corresponding exclusion versions (e.g. `--no-tool`).

Use `--list` to see the list of available tools, or see below.

### Specifying the MCP Client

Different clients have varying abilities to handle arbitrary tools and schemas.

You can specify the client you are using with the `--client` argument, and the MCP server will automatically
serve tools and schemas that are more compatible with that client.

- `--client=<type>`: Set all capabilities based on a known MCP client

  - Valid values: `openai-agents`, `claude`, `claude-code`, `cursor`
  - Example: `--client=cursor`

Additionally, if you have a client not on the above list, or the client has gotten better
over time, you can manually enable or disable certain capabilities:

- `--capability=<name>`: Specify individual client capabilities
  - Available capabilities:
    - `top-level-unions`: Enable support for top-level unions in tool schemas
    - `valid-json`: Enable JSON string parsing for arguments
    - `refs`: Enable support for $ref pointers in schemas
    - `unions`: Enable support for union types (anyOf) in schemas
    - `formats`: Enable support for format validations in schemas (e.g. date-time, email)
    - `tool-name-length=N`: Set maximum tool name length to N characters
  - Example: `--capability=top-level-unions --capability=tool-name-length=40`
  - Example: `--capability=top-level-unions,tool-name-length=40`

### Examples

1. Filter for read operations on cards:

```bash
--resource=cards --operation=read
```

2. Exclude specific tools while including others:

```bash
--resource=cards --no-tool=create_cards
```

3. Configure for Cursor client with custom max tool name length:

```bash
--client=cursor --capability=tool-name-length=40
```

4. Complex filtering with multiple criteria:

```bash
--resource=cards,accounts --operation=read --tag=kyc --no-tool=create_cards
```

## Importing the tools and server individually

```js
// Import the server, generated endpoints, or the init function
import { server, endpoints, init } from "@nbai/sdk-mcp/server";

// import a specific tool
import createFleetifyRoutes from "@nbai/sdk-mcp/tools/fleetify/routes/create-fleetify-routes";

// initialize the server and all endpoints
init({ server, endpoints });

// manually start server
const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);

// or initialize your own server with specific tools
const myServer = new McpServer(...);

// define your own endpoint
const myCustomEndpoint = {
  tool: {
    name: 'my_custom_tool',
    description: 'My custom tool',
    inputSchema: zodToJsonSchema(z.object({ a_property: z.string() })),
  },
  handler: async (client: client, args: any) => {
    return { myResponse: 'Hello world!' };
  })
};

// initialize the server with your custom endpoints
init({ server: myServer, endpoints: [createFleetifyRoutes, myCustomEndpoint] });
```

  Use this method to find known places in default or your own custom (proprietary) dataset and get a combined search result. It accepts free-form, partially correct or even incomplete search texts. Results would be ranked based on the search score of a place.

### Resource `multigeocode.place`:

- `create_multigeocode_place` (`write`): The "Add Place" method allows users to create custom places

  Add place method provides the flexibility to create custom places in a way that suits your business needs. The newly created place and its attributes can be added to custom (proprietary) dataset - to the effect of building your own places dataset (s) - or, to a default dataset. Overcome inaccurate â€˜POIâ€™ details from default search provider by creating custom, highly accurate â€˜POIsâ€™.

- `retrieve_multigeocode_place` (`read`): Use this method to get the details of previously created custom places using its NextBillion ID.
- `update_multigeocode_place` (`write`): The "Update Place" method allows businesses to update the attributes of an existing place.

  This method allows you to update the attributes of custom places. In effect, updating a place replaces the current information in search results with the updated information associated with the specific docID. Use this method to enhance the accuracy/usability of your search results with respect to the default dataset to suit your business needs.

  If you want to prioritize a particular result in your search results, update the â€˜scoreâ€™ of that specific place.  
  Alternatively, you can block places which are no longer needed by setting their status: â€˜disableâ€™.

- `delete_multigeocode_place` (`write`): The "Delete Place" method enables businesses to delete a previously created place

  Use this method to delete a previously created place. Please note that the place associated with the specified docID only would be deleted. As a result, once a place is deleted, the search API can still return valid results from the default datasets or others, if present.

### Resource `revgeocode`:

- `retrieve_revgeocode` (`read`): Reverse Geocode

### Resource `route_report`:

- `create_route_report` (`write`): Route Report

### Resource `snap_to_roads`:

You can set various parameters, such as timestamps or radius, to optimize the result.
